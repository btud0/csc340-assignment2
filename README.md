This is a static web page project built for my software engineering class. 
It is meant to showcase a gallery of fictional characters using HTML, bootstrap,
css and basic JavaScript for filtering in the search bar. Includes a navigation
bar that is standard to all pages, a parent home page, three child pages including: 
details, about, and new-character-form.
