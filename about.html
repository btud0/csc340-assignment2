            <h1>About This Site:</h1>
            <p>This webpage is an assignment for the software engineering class that I am in.
                I was required to choose a fictional universe that I enjoy and make character
                cards that explain the characters. I chose Jujutsu Kaisen because this is a popular tv show that has new episodes coming out that
                me and my girlfriend have been watching regularly. It has mature themes compared to most anime tv
                shows and is really interesting. The animation is very high quality as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I think simple styles go a long way on a webpage. I chose to use bootstrap css because
                it is easily implemented. I like the dark look for the navbar that contrasts the lighter
                images and background. I chose blue for the character details because I find that it matches with
                the character images fairly well. The hardest challenge in this assignment was learning how to 
                transfer my Java skills to JavaScript as I have very little experience with it. <br>
